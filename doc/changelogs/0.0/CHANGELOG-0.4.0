Changes for 0.4.0 (as gmaplocation extension)

- Resolved a few warnings and error messages.

- Much simpler install - modified the javascript so that no template changes
  are required in the admin design.

- The editing controls will now work properly if there are multiple location
  attributes on a single object.

- In the editing view, the map will now re-center on the clicked point. This
  makes it easier to use the click-point and zoome controls to hone in on a
  specific point.

- The edit map now defaults to a zoom-level-0 view of the globe instead of
  a gray square.

- The edit map is larger, so that the map type and directional controls don't
  overlap.

- A new template has been included, gmap.tpl. This is a multi-purpose template
  that can be included and configured to handle several common use-cases for
  the gmaps datatype. See the doc on the template for specifics.
